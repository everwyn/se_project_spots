**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

HTML file is index.html which houses the page coding

**CSS**

The bulk of the page is managed by CSS in order to set styling
